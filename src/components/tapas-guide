    <p>
      In Madrid, tapas are more than just small plates of food; they are a cherished social ritual and an integral part of the city's soul. The art of <em>ir de tapas</em> (tapas hopping) involves moving from one bustling bar to the next, enjoying a small drink (a <em>caña</em> of beer or a glass of vermouth) and a signature snack at each stop. From century-old taverns serving classic recipes to avant-garde kitchens reinventing Spanish cuisine, this guide will lead you to the most authentic and delicious tapas experiences Madrid has to offer.
